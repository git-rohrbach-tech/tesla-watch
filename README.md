# tesla-watch

Open source Tesla Apple Watch app. There are plenty of Tesla Apple Watch apps out there, I plainly just don't trust them. [So I'm going to write my own!](./media/bender.png)

The motivation for this project is to allow all Apple Watch users to be able to send commands to their Tesla via their Apple Watch, and not have to be curious if their information is being stolen in the background. This app is open source, this app is free, and it will always be that way.
